    # { Text = "F1",  Action = "F1", Stretch = 2  },
    # { Text = "F2",  Action = "F2", Stretch = 2  },

    # { Text = "F5",  Action = "F5", Stretch = 2  },
    # { Text = "F6",  Action = "F6", Stretch = 2  },
    # { Text = "F7",  Action = "F7", Stretch = 2  },

    # { Time = "12hr",  Action = "Time"},
    # Example of Time with locale:
    # { Time = "12hr",  Locale = "en_IN", Action = "Time"},
    # Example of Time with stretch:
    # # the time key by default will be too small to accomodate date and time.
    # # So it is recommended to have a stretch of atleast 3 times the rest keys.
    # { Time = "12hr",  Action = "Time", Stretch = 3},
    # You can also put in your format string directly.
    # The available variables can be found here: https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html
    # If your time block says "Time format error" you are using some invalid parameter.
    # { Time = "%H:%M %-e.%m.%Y", Action = "Time", Stretch = 2}

    # Example of Battery:
    # { Battery = "percentage", Action = "Battery" }
    # This will display a button showing the current battery percentage.
    # { Battery = "icon", Action = "Battery" }
    # This will display a button showing a battery icon instead of percentage.
    # { Battery = "both", Action = "Battery" }
    # This will display a button showing a battery icon as well as percentage.
    # The logic used to calcuate the percentage will be:
    # 1. On T2 Macs:
    # (Amount of energy currently available / Amount of energy in the battery when itâ€™s considered full) * 100
    # 2. On Apple Silicon Macs:
    # Get the value reported by the SMC in /sys/class/power_supply.
    # Button will turn green if battery is charging, and red if charge is <10% and is not charging.
