# Enhanced tiny-dfr

The most basic dynamic function row daemon possible for macbook touchbars

## Overview

this enhanced tiny-dfr provides customizable Touch Bar functionality on macbooks running arch linux with Omarchy specifically, thou might support other distros as well. By default, the Touch Bar works in the same mode as Windows Bootcamp, but tiny-dfr allows you to customize it with your own layouts and functions.

### Features
- Customizable Touch Bar layouts and functions
- **Hardware keyboard backlight control** - Automatically detects and controls keyboard backlight on supported MacBooks
- **Command execution** - Execute custom shell commands and applications from Touch Bar buttons
- **Per-button outline customization** - Individual control over button outline visibility and colors
- Icon themes and customization
- Systemd integration for automatic startup

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Required kernel modules for T2: `apple-bce`, `hid-appletb-kbd`, `hid-appletb-bl`

### Dependencies
- cairo
- libinput
- freetype
- fontconfig
- librsvg 2.59 or later
- uinput enabled in kernel config

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

Run the automated installation script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/tiny-dfr.git
cd tiny-dfr
chmod +x install-tiny-dfr.sh
./install-tiny-dfr.sh
```

The script will:
- Detect your Linux distribution and install dependencies
- Build tiny-dfr from source
- Install and configure the systemd service
- Set up the default configuration
- Start the service automatically

## Configuration

### Basic Setup
1. Copy the default config and commands:
```bash
sudo cp /usr/share/tiny-dfr/config.toml /etc/tiny-dfr/config.toml
sudo cp /usr/share/tiny-dfr/commands.toml /etc/tiny-dfr/commands.toml
```

2. Edit the configuration:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/tiny-dfr/config.toml
```

### Configuration Options
The config file allows you to customize:
- Touch Bar layout and buttons
- Icon sets and themes
- Key bindings and functions
- Display settings
- **Per-button outline customization** - Control visibility and colors of button outlines individually
- **Custom button outline colors** - Use grayscale or RGB colors for unique button styling

See the config file comments for detailed options.

### Restart Service After Config Changes
```bash
sudo systemctl restart tiny-dfr
```

## Command Execution

enhanced tiny-dfr supports executing custom shell commands and applications from Touch Bar buttons using the `Command_X` action system.

### Configuration

Commands are loaded with the following priority:
- Base commands from `/usr/share/tiny-dfr/commands.toml`
- User overrides from `/etc/tiny-dfr/commands.toml` (takes precedence)

1. **Define commands** in `/etc/tiny-dfr/commands.toml`:
```toml
# Example commands
Command_1 = "firefox"
Command_2 = "omarchy-menu capture"
Command_3 = "walker -p \"Launchâ€¦\""
Command_4 = "alacritty"
Command_5 = "rofi -show drun"
```

2. **Use commands** in `/etc/tiny-dfr/config.toml`:
```toml
MediaLayerKeys = [
    { Icon = "firefox", Action = "Command_1" },
    { Icon = "capture", Action = "Command_2" },
    { Icon = "apps",    Action = "Command_3" },
    # ... other buttons
]
```

### Features

- **Full user environment**: Commands run with your complete shell environment and theming
- **GUI application support**: Automatic display environment setup for Wayland/X11 applications
- **Dynamic user detection**: Works across different users without hardcoded paths
- **Background execution**: Commands run asynchronously without blocking the Touch Bar

**Note**: Command execution has been tested on Arch Linux with Omarchy. Other distributions and desktop environments may require additional configuration.

## Button Outline Customization

tiny-dfr supports advanced per-button outline customization, allowing you to create visually distinct button categories with custom colors and visibility settings.

### Per-Button Outline Control

You can control outline visibility for individual buttons, overriding the global `ShowButtonOutlines` setting:

```toml
MediaLayerKeys = [
    { Icon = "omarchy", Action = "Command_1", ShowButtonOutlines = false },
    { Battery = "both", Action = "Battery", ShowButtonOutlines = true },
    { Time = "%I:%M%P", Action = "Time", ShowButtonOutlines = true },
]
```

### Custom Outline Colors

Each button can have its own outline color using the `ButtonOutlinesColor` field:

```toml
MediaLayerKeys = [
    # Grayscale color (0.0 = black, 1.0 = white)
    { Icon = "some-icon", Action = "SomeAction", ShowButtonOutlines = true, ButtonOutlinesColor = 0.5 },

    # RGB color array [red, green, blue] (0.0 to 1.0 range)
    { Time = "%I:%M%P", Action = "Time", ShowButtonOutlines = true, ButtonOutlinesColor = [0.2, 0.8, 1.0] },
]
```

### Color Formats

- **Grayscale**: Single floating-point value from 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white)
- **RGB**: Array of three floating-point values [red, green, blue], each from 0.0 to 1.0
- **Fallback**: If no custom color is specified, uses the default outline color

### Battery Button Colors

The battery button automatically changes colors based on its state, regardless of custom outline colors:
- **Charging**: Green outline/background
- **Low battery (<10%)**: Red outline/background
- **Normal**: Uses configured outline color or default gray

## Keyboard Backlight Support

tiny-dfr automatically detects and controls hardware keyboard backlight on supported MacBooks. The system searches for keyboard backlight devices in the following priority order:

1. **T2 Mac specific path**: `/sys/class/leds/:white:kbd_backlight`
2. **Path with SMC prefix**: `/sys/class/leds/smc::kbd_backlight`
3. **Generic search**: Any device in `/sys/class/leds/` containing "kbd" or "keyboard"

### Testing and Feedback Needed

**Are you using a T1 or T2 MacBook?** I need your help to improve keyboard backlight compatibility!

If keyboard backlight isn't working on your MacBook, please:
1. Check what keyboard backlight devices exist on your system:
   ```bash
   ls -la /sys/class/leds/ | grep -i kbd
   # or
   find /sys/class/leds/ -name "*kbd*" -o -name "*keyboard*"
   ```

2. Report your findings in a GitHub issue with:
   - Your MacBook model (e.g., MacBook Pro 13,3, MacBook Air 8,1)
   - The path(s) found by the commands above
   - Whether you're using T1 or T2 hardware

This helps me add support for more MacBook touchbar models if any!

## Troubleshooting

### Touch Bar Not Working
1. Ensure T2 kernel modules are loaded:
```bash
lsmod | grep -E "(apple-bce|hid-appletb)"
```

2. Check if uinput is enabled:
```bash
lsmod | grep uinput
```

3. Verify service status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status tiny-dfr
```

### Keyboard Backlight Issues
1. Check if keyboard backlight was detected at startup:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u tiny-dfr | grep -i "keyboard"
```

2. Manually check for keyboard backlight devices:
```bash
ls -la /sys/class/leds/ | grep -E "(kbd|keyboard)"
```

### Service Issues
```bash
# View logs
sudo journalctl -u tiny-dfr -f

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart tiny-dfr

# Check config syntax
sudo tiny-dfr --check-config
```
