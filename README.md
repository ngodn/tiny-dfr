- Set up the default configuration
- Start the service automatically

## Configuration

### Basic Setup
1. Copy the default config and commands:
```bash
sudo cp /usr/share/tiny-dfr/config.toml /etc/tiny-dfr/config.toml
sudo cp /usr/share/tiny-dfr/commands.toml /etc/tiny-dfr/commands.toml
```

2. Edit the configuration:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/tiny-dfr/config.toml
```

### Configuration Options
The config file allows you to customize:
- Touch Bar layout and buttons
- Icon sets and themes
- Key bindings and functions
- Display settings
- **Per-button outline customization** - Control visibility and colors of button outlines individually
- **Custom button outline colors** - Use grayscale or RGB colors for unique button styling

See the config file comments for detailed options.

### Restart Service After Config Changes
```bash
sudo systemctl restart tiny-dfr
```

## Command Execution

enhanced tiny-dfr supports executing custom shell commands and applications from Touch Bar buttons using the `Command_X` action system.

### Configuration

Commands are loaded with the following priority:
- Base commands from `/usr/share/tiny-dfr/commands.toml`
- User overrides from `/etc/tiny-dfr/commands.toml` (takes precedence)

1. **Define commands** in `/etc/tiny-dfr/commands.toml`:
```toml
# Example commands
Command_1 = "firefox"
Command_2 = "omarchy-menu capture"
Command_3 = "walker -p \"Launchâ€¦\""
Command_4 = "alacritty"
Command_5 = "rofi -show drun"
```

2. **Use commands** in `/etc/tiny-dfr/config.toml`:
```toml
MediaLayerKeys = [
    { Icon = "firefox", Action = "Command_1" },
    { Icon = "capture", Action = "Command_2" },
    { Icon = "apps",    Action = "Command_3" },
    # ... other buttons
]
```

### Features

- **Full user environment**: Commands run with your complete shell environment and theming
- **GUI application support**: Automatic display environment setup for Wayland/X11 applications
- **Dynamic user detection**: Works across different users without hardcoded paths
- **Background execution**: Commands run asynchronously without blocking the Touch Bar

**Note**: Command execution has been tested on Arch Linux with Omarchy. Other distributions and desktop environments may require additional configuration.

## Hyprland Integration

Enhanced tiny-dfr provides deep integration with Hyprland window manager, offering real-time active window display and context-aware expandable actions.

### Features

- **Real-time active window tracking** - Displays current window title and class instantly
- **Dynamic app icon detection** - Automatically shows app-specific icons using `app-{class}` pattern
- **Expandable context actions** - Touch Bar buttons can expand to show window-specific actions
- **Multiple display modes** - Text-only, icon-only, or combined text+icon display
- **Performance optimized** - Uses background threading and caching for <5ms response times

### Configuration

#### Basic Hyprland Button

Add a Hyprland plugin button to your Touch Bar configuration:

```toml
MediaLayerKeys = [
    # Text mode - shows window title with optional app icon
    { Text = "plugin-hyprland", Action = "Hyprland_Expand_ActiveWindow",
      ShowButtonOutlines = true, ButtonTitle = "title",
      ShowAppIconAlongsideText = true, Stretch = 8 },

    # Icon mode - shows only app icon
    { Icon = "plugin-hyprland-icon", Action = "Hyprland_Expand_ActiveWindow",
      ShowButtonOutlines = true, Stretch = 8 },
]
```

#### Expandable Actions

Configure window-specific actions in `/etc/tiny-dfr/hyprland.toml`:

```toml
[[Hyprland_Expand_ActiveWindow]]
class = "code"
button_title = "title"
layer_keys = [
    { Icon = "color_picker", Action = "Command_ColorPicker" },
    { Icon = "terminal", Action = "Command_Terminal" },
    { Icon = "screenshot", Action = "Command_Screenshot" },
]

[[Hyprland_Expand_ActiveWindow]]
class = "firefox"
button_title = "title"
layer_keys = [
    { Icon = "screenrecord", Action = "Command_ScreenRecord" },
    { Icon = "screenshot", Action = "Command_Screenshot" },
]
```

### Display Modes

| Mode | Configuration | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Text Only** | `Text = "plugin-hyprland"` | Shows window title as text |
| **Text + Icon** | `Text = "plugin-hyprland"` + `ShowAppIconAlongsideText = true` | Shows app icon with window title |
| **Icon Only** | `Icon = "plugin-hyprland-icon"` | Shows only app icon |

### Button Behavior

1. **Main Layer**: Shows current active window information
2. **Tap to Expand**: Button expands to show window-specific actions plus Back button
3. **Back Navigation**: Returns to main layer while preserving button display mode
4. **Real-time Updates**: Instantly updates when switching between applications

### App Icon Detection

The system automatically detects app icons using this priority:
1. **App-specific icon**: `/usr/share/tiny-dfr/app-{class}.svg` (e.g., `app-code.svg`, `app-firefox.svg`)
2. **System theme icon**: Uses freedesktop.org icon themes
3. **Default fallback**: `application-default-icon`
4. **Plugin fallback**: `plugin-hyprland.svg`

### Performance Features

- **Background icon caching** - Icons are pre-loaded and cached for instant display
- **Async icon loading** - Missing icons load in background without blocking UI
- **Optimized window tracking** - Uses Hyprland's real-time event system
- **Response time**: <5ms for window switching and button updates

## Performance Optimizations

Enhanced tiny-dfr includes comprehensive performance optimizations for responsive Touch Bar experience:

### Background Threading Architecture

- **Icon Cache System** - Pre-loads and caches commonly used icons at startup
- **Battery Monitor Thread** - Monitors battery state in background, updates every 30 seconds
- **System Monitor Thread** - Handles time updates and cache cleanup scheduling
- **User Environment Cache** - Pre-detects user environment for instant command execution
- **Hyprland Event Listener** - Real-time window tracking via background socket connection

### Caching Strategy

- **Icon preloading** - Common icons (`back`, `settings`, `application-default-icon`) loaded at startup
- **App icon caching** - Frequently used app icons cached with LRU eviction (5-minute TTL)
- **Path-based caching** - Thread-safe file path caching instead of loaded image objects
- **Fallback chains** - Multi-level fallback with pre-cached alternatives

### Performance Metrics

| Operation | Before Optimization | After Optimization |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Command execution** | 50-200ms (blocking) | ~0ms (cached environment) |
| **Icon loading** | 10-50ms per icon | ~1-5ms (cache hit) |
| **Window switching** | 40-200ms | <5ms (real-time events) |
| **Battery updates** | Blocking I/O | Background cached |
| **UI responsiveness** | Can lag during I/O | Consistent <10ms |

### Memory Management

- **Automatic cache cleanup** - Removes unused icons after 5 minutes
- **Bounded cache size** - Prevents unlimited memory growth
- **Efficient data structures** - Path-based storage reduces memory footprint
- **Background garbage collection** - Non-blocking cleanup operations

## Button Outline Customization

tiny-dfr supports advanced per-button outline customization, allowing you to create visually distinct button categories with custom colors and visibility settings.

### Per-Button Outline Control

You can control outline visibility for individual buttons, overriding the global `ShowButtonOutlines` setting:

```toml
MediaLayerKeys = [
    { Icon = "omarchy", Action = "Command_1", ShowButtonOutlines = false },
    { Battery = "both", Action = "Battery", ShowButtonOutlines = true },
    { Time = "%I:%M%P", Action = "Time", ShowButtonOutlines = true },
]
```

### Custom Outline Colors

Each button can have its own outline color using the `ButtonOutlinesColor` field:

```toml
MediaLayerKeys = [
    # Grayscale color (0.0 = black, 1.0 = white)
    { Icon = "some-icon", Action = "SomeAction", ShowButtonOutlines = true, ButtonOutlinesColor = 0.5 },

    # RGB color array [red, green, blue] (0.0 to 1.0 range)
    { Time = "%I:%M%P", Action = "Time", ShowButtonOutlines = true, ButtonOutlinesColor = [0.2, 0.8, 1.0] },
]
```

### Color Formats

- **Grayscale**: Single floating-point value from 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white)
- **RGB**: Array of three floating-point values [red, green, blue], each from 0.0 to 1.0
- **Fallback**: If no custom color is specified, uses the default outline color

### Battery Button Colors

The battery button automatically changes colors based on its state, regardless of custom outline colors:
- **Charging**: Green outline/background
- **Low battery (<10%)**: Red outline/background
- **Normal**: Uses configured outline color or default gray

## Keyboard Backlight Support

tiny-dfr automatically detects and controls hardware keyboard backlight on supported MacBooks. The system searches for keyboard backlight devices in the following priority order:

1. **T2 Mac specific path**: `/sys/class/leds/:white:kbd_backlight`
2. **Path with SMC prefix**: `/sys/class/leds/smc::kbd_backlight`
3. **Generic search**: Any device in `/sys/class/leds/` containing "kbd" or "keyboard"

### Testing and Feedback Needed

**Are you using a T1 or T2 MacBook?** I need your help to improve keyboard backlight compatibility!

If keyboard backlight isn't working on your MacBook, please:
1. Check what keyboard backlight devices exist on your system:
   ```bash
   ls -la /sys/class/leds/ | grep -i kbd
   # or
   find /sys/class/leds/ -name "*kbd*" -o -name "*keyboard*"
   ```

2. Report your findings in a GitHub issue with:
   - Your MacBook model (e.g., MacBook Pro 13,3, MacBook Air 8,1)
   - The path(s) found by the commands above
   - Whether you're using T1 or T2 hardware

This helps me add support for more MacBook touchbar models if any!

## Troubleshooting

### Touch Bar Not Working
1. Ensure T2 kernel modules are loaded:
```bash
lsmod | grep -E "(apple-bce|hid-appletb)"
```

2. Check if uinput is enabled:
```bash
lsmod | grep uinput
```

3. Verify service status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status tiny-dfr
```

### Keyboard Backlight Issues
1. Check if keyboard backlight was detected at startup:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u tiny-dfr | grep -i "keyboard"
```

2. Manually check for keyboard backlight devices:
```bash
ls -la /sys/class/leds/ | grep -E "(kbd|keyboard)"
```

### Service Issues
```bash
# View logs
sudo journalctl -u tiny-dfr -f

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart tiny-dfr

# Check config syntax
sudo tiny-dfr --check-config
```
